</a>
    </h1>

    <div class="postbody e-content"><div style="max-width: 700px;"><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%;"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2263237961/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/minimal=true/transparent=true/" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Last year's album <em>It's Sorted</em> felt kind of like they had polished the whole Cheekface bit to a perfect point so it's not surprising that this one would be a ~transitional record~; it sounds like the members of the band have been through a lot in the last year (relatable!) and this album is being kind of press junketed as the result of that but I'm not sure that really pays off. I think it's cool that they collaborated with McKinley Dixon for "Military Gum" but I'm not sure the result is as good as a Cheekface track or a McKinley Dixon track. "Growth Sux" has a funny and possibly insightful point but to me it feels like they barely scratched the surface and I find it hard to say where their commonly-employed satirical voice ends on the topic, which sort of defeats the point of their whole schtick.</p>
<p>I do think there's something cool that's happening with Cheekface's particular blend of music and writing and comedy and politics and I want to see it continue and get better and smarter. There are individual moments on here that are catchy enough that I'm sure they will pop into my head unbidden for years to come ("Wind is Gone"'s refrain of "Dial 999-9999" has been on loop, maddeningly, for the past 48 hours), but... I dunno. I'm not seeing the depth that I know they are capable of.</p>

</a>
    </h1>

    <div class="postbody e-content"><div id="RKOpb-fZdnI" class="eleventy-plugin-youtube-embed" style="position:relative;width:100%;padding-top: 56.25%;"><iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;right:0;bottom:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" title="Embedded YouTube video" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RKOpb-fZdnI" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Your Old Droog is the kind of rapper who can release a song with Denzel Curry and Method Man verses and a <em>Celebrity Death Match</em>-inspired music video in 2024 and still be someone you might not know exists; a weird mix of access to the ability to realize a creative vision and also criminal near-anonymity in the mainstream. I was made aware of him via his 2017 collaboration with Heems "Bangladesh", a song I'll probably dedicate at least one full post to at some point, and I did listen to the album it was on (<em>Packs</em>) a decent amount, but I somehow checked out for... 6 albums in 7 years after that?</p>
<p><em>Movie</em>, from last year, has <em>Pretty Toney</em>-era decadence vibes. "I Think I Love Her" is a slick parasocial love song complete with a music video that feels like the perfect companion to Charli XCX's "Boys" visual. "Mantra" addresses his upbringing as a Russian immigrant. "The Interview" is maybe the funniest skit I've heard on a hip-hop album since Prince Paul's peak? "What Else" recalls Clipse's "Mr. Me Too" with its confidence.</p>
<p>There's also an incredible punch-in tactic at play on a handful of tracks on this album where Droog acts as his own... hype man, sort of? Because one of the things that he does is self-consciously shout "what?" or "who?" whenever he makes a reference that I guess he thinks is too obscure? It's so funny and weird and charming and is honestly the best argument for why you should listen to this album, so I'll stop there.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="postbody e-content"><div style="max-width: 700px;"><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%;"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3903158746/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/minimal=true/transparent=true/" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div>
<p>Cliffdiver's second full-length album really delivered for me. It's not surprising in hindsight that their debut album <a href="https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/album/exercise-your-demons">Exercise Your Demons</a> wouldn't live up to the high expectations set by their 2020 song <a href="https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/track/gas-city">Gas City</a>; it's by all means a good album but for me it lacked the sort of top-tier memorability that I'm looking for when listening to this sort of on-the-nose pop-punk "DIY" music. Birdwatching, as a counterpoint, sold me from the very start with opener "thirty, flirty, and thriving!!!" Co-lead vocalists Joey Duffy and Briana Wright are both extremely charming, the band's work continues to be my favorite use of the saxophone in recent memory, the whole album kinda breezes by and dares you to go back to the start and listen all over again like many of my favorite albums this year, and I would like one hundred more years of Cliffdiver songs to put me in a good mood and make me feel thirty years old again.</p>

<p>This second album by the Australian slacker-rock duo is a perfect example of why I love <a href="https://runforcoverrecords.com/">Run For Cover Records</a>. It's unfortunately brief, weighing in at just 19 minutes across 7 tracks, but I had it in the rotation pretty regularly in 2024. The lofi music videos put out over the course of the year match the vibe pretty well. More of this please!</p>
