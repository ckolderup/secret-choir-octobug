<p>the "You Could Make a Case For" series is for albums that did not spring to mind for me immediately, but when reviewing the stuff I did actually listen to this year, I noticed them as things that I definitely did find myself pressing play on during the course of the year.</p>
<p>I first learned about Durante via the 2019 Fabric DJ mix by electronic artist Bonobo, an album I listened to constantly both by myself and when putting on music for other people. His track "Maia" swoops in beautifully and while he didn't have many tracks released at that point, I was excited eventually to discover his 2021 song "Thread Tension", a driving, hypnotic track. There were some releases here and there but it was this year's <em>Enter</em> and the accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWdIkR-6Vio">February</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh246_Mgk7o">May</a> DJ mixes that I could tell there was something special he was doing, creating a sound I'm really glad to have had available to me this year.</p>
