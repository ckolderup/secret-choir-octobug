    <div class="postbody e-content"><p>I did some end-of-the-year music type things across different "platforms" this year. Here are each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>I rounded up <a href="https://record.club/casey/lists/favorite-albums-of-2025">my favorite albums of the year</a> on record.club, along with thoughts about each of them. I'm trying to spend more time on record.club and less time on other social media platforms!</li>
<li>I made an (unordered, intended to be shuffled) playlist of <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/2025-soty/pl.u-j259FoRz6L">the songs that felt most important to me in 2025</a> on Apple Music.</li>
<li>Lastly, there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLllE32KGRnm0bBJgRgqVmYatyoLn69d4f">a YouTube playlist with my favorite music videos of 2025</a>, ordered chronologically by release date. It doesn't stand out to me as an <em>incredible</em> year for music videos but there are some really good ones and as I've said elsewhere Doechii kind of set the bar impossibly high with her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cdbR5ognY&list=RDF0cdbR5ognY">January 2 music video release</a> for the previous year's single "Denial is a River", which you should really watch if you haven't.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that's it for 2025 as a real focus, though obviously I will continue talking about music that was released in all years, not just the present one, here on this website. I'm already looking forward to new albums and concerts and whatever else 2026 has in store!</p>
