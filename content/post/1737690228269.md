This second album by the Australian slacker-rock duo is a perfect example of why I love [Run For Cover Records](https://runforcoverrecords.com/). It&#x27;s unfortunately brief, weighing in at just 19 minutes across 7 tracks, but I had it in the rotation pretty regularly in 2024. The lofi music videos put out over the course of the year match the vibe pretty well. More of this please!
