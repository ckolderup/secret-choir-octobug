if you were reasonably certain that you could hear a misprogrammed snare in a song that has 500k views on YouTube by an artist with 600k monthly listeners that is generally fun but obviously (as a result of the snare) now is unlistenable, would you try and contact someone in the song&#x27;s production team to issue a corrected version on streaming services or do you live a normal, happy life
