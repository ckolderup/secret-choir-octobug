I remember having a complicated relationship with this song when it came out in (checks notes) 7th grade. It was a weirdly compelling banger to a random white kid in sort of the &#x22;strip mall belt&#x22; of the midwest? the costuming was not of interest to me, a kid terrified of a) sex and b) the occult, which is funny to say on the other side of the grimes experiment. I did like that there were stringed instruments (I was a self-identified Suzuki Kid, so violins felt like representation). unfortunately, thanks to my NPR-listening ass, I had the gall to suggest that the vocal melodies were derivative of Enya. but like, this moment exists:

and that&#x27;s pretty sick, right?

In conclusion, Madonna&#x27;s _Ray of Light_ is a land of contrasts
