This song/video is such a great encapsulation of the different talents within a given &#x22;movement&#x22; I see in any genre of music right now. It&#x27;s from a little over a year ago so things might be different now (or in the future) BUT

Here&#x27;s three and a half minutes of music billed to Latto but featuring Flo Milli, a slightly more gimmick-credited rapper, and Megan Thee Stallion, who is herself a kind of regulated, brand-safe version of Nicki Minaj. The breadth of their careers/statuses/talents is important here. Also Glorilla, ANOTHER trending female rapper, who has her own distinct place in the zeitgeist, is hanging out and does lip syncing at key moments in the video. She&#x27;s not credited at all, she just wants to be around. It&#x27;s a distinct cultural moment!!!
