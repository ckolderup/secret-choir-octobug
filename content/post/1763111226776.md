kinda cool in hindsight that Vampire Weekend&#x27;s &#x22;Capricorn&#x22;, a song that celebrates things that come into being at the very end of the year and considers the challenges they face, happened the same year that Cameron Winter released &#x22;Heavy Metal&#x22; on December 6 a full 25 days before the end of the year AND YET was excluded from many &#x22;Best of the Year&#x22; (&#x22;BOTY&#x22;) considerations AND is now awkwardly being shoehorned into some of this year&#x27;s lists instead out of a sense of regret for not recognizing its impact, partially because of the work itself and partially because of the way it was leveraged into an increased sense of hype for Cameron&#x27;s band&#x27;s incredibly hyped record _Getting Killed_, which will also surely earn many accolades in this year&#x27;s considerations
