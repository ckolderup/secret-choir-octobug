Have I seriously not talked about Saving Connie on this blog? This is a YouTube channel by a producer/DJ/mashup artist/music influencer who does a variety of music-related things on his channel. One of them is called &#x22;Connie TV&#x22; and is a series of videos that are like a mashup DJ set of popular hip-hop infused with R&#x26;B/pop/indie music with well-curated video footage that mixes music videos and footage from the music&#x27;s creators alongside some ~ good content ~, providing a sort of just-voicy-enough aesthetic that feels trend-chasing but also original at the same time. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a vibier way to spend an hour or two than one of these compilations.
