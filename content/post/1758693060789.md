to me, Track Star* is one of these kind of broad celebrity interview brands that are kind of interesting to me but that I am wary of, along with Hot Ones, Chicken Shop Date, The Terrell Show, Therapuss, Ziwe, Nardwuar, and apparently SubwayTakes now?

For me the central problem with Track Star* is that I am unable to watch it without trying to decide how much of it, for this particular guest, is a &#x22;work&#x22;. I&#x27;m even pretty sure that no matter how much of a work the central trivia concept is, it probably is more of a work than that.

BUT DESPITE THAT I do find myself enjoying both of these fairly recent videos from this channel. Check these out, first the one with Spike Lee and A$AP Rocky, then the one from yesterday with Mark Ronson:

Like... pretty fun!
