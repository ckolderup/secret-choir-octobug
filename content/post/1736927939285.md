the &#x22;You Could Make a Case For&#x22; series is for albums that did not spring to mind for me immediately, but when reviewing the stuff I did actually listen to this year, I noticed them as things that I definitely did find myself pressing play on during the course of the year.

I first learned about Durante via the 2019 Fabric DJ mix by electronic artist Bonobo, an album I listened to constantly both by myself and when putting on music for other people. His track &#x22;Maia&#x22; swoops in beautifully and while he didn&#x27;t have many tracks released at that point, I was excited eventually to discover his 2021 song &#x22;Thread Tension&#x22;, a driving, hypnotic track. There were some releases here and there but it was this year&#x27;s _Enter_ and the accompanying [February](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWdIkR-6Vio) and [May](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh246_Mgk7o) DJ mixes that I could tell there was something special he was doing, creating a sound I&#x27;m really glad to have had available to me this year.
