I dunno what to say about this one, it just is the mood I felt in the most this year. I felt ready to put this on just about any time-- as a plane was landing, when I couldn&#x27;t sleep, when I had a quiet afternoon sitting around peacefully with my parents in my new living room, when I was walking around a new part of San Francisco I had never been in before (near the Moscone Center? lol), just any time really. I guess that makes it the next in a series:

2024 - this one
2023 - overmono - good lies
2022 - sadurn - radiator
2021 - ross from friends - tread
2020 - cartalk - pass like pollen
2019 - glass beach - the first glass beach album
