Aesop Rock&#x27;s &#x22;Get Out of the Car&#x22;, the track that contains in its lyrics the title of the album it was on, is a tribute track to his friend and collaborator Camu Tao and a reflection on the extended period of time between Tao&#x27;s death in 2008 and the album&#x27;s release in 2016 during which Aes admitted to struggling with in terms of mental health and social connection. It&#x27;s a beautiful song and a great video to accompany it.
