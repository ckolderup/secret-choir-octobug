KRAMER: the kids have revived indie sleaze, jerry. They&#x27;re making crystal castles interpolations.
JERRY: what about Sleepyhead? I miss Sleepyhead! It was a good song! Maybe Passion Pit could just come back and do that again?!?
KRAMER: (desperate) there&#x27;s no time to worry about passion pit, Jerry! It&#x27;s only a matter of time before they find out about lil debbie!
