I did some end-of-the-year music type things across different &#x22;platforms&#x22; this year. Here are each of them:

* I rounded up [my favorite albums of the year](https://record.club/casey/lists/favorite-albums-of-2025) on record.club, along with thoughts about each of them. I&#x27;m trying to spend more time on record.club and less time on other social media platforms!
* I made an (unordered, intended to be shuffled) playlist of [the songs that felt most important to me in 2025](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/2025-soty/pl.u-j259FoRz6L) on Apple Music.
* Lastly, there&#x27;s [a YouTube playlist with my favorite music videos of 2025](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLllE32KGRnm0bBJgRgqVmYatyoLn69d4f), ordered chronologically by release date. It doesn&#x27;t stand out to me as an _incredible_ year for music videos but there are some really good ones and as I&#x27;ve said elsewhere Doechii kind of set the bar impossibly high with her [January 2 music video release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0cdbR5ognY&#x26;list=RDF0cdbR5ognY) for the previous year&#x27;s single &#x22;Denial is a River&#x22;, which you should really watch if you haven&#x27;t.

I think that&#x27;s it for 2025 as a real focus, though obviously I will continue talking about music that was released in all years, not just the present one, here on this website. I&#x27;m already looking forward to new albums and concerts and whatever else 2026 has in store!
