Listening to this album does make me feel alive-- alive because I can hear the influences from Porter Robinson and Madeon, from chiptunes to blasted out VHS copies of anime series you&#x27;ve never remembered the title of recovered from a friends of the library table sale. Listen to this album if you&#x27;re a little goblin in the forest in an RPG Maker game
