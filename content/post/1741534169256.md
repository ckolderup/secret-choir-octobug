here&#x2019;s an album that&#x2019;s a great example of &#x201C;I put it on while doing something else and found it vaguely pleasant; I sat down and listened to it while doing little else and realized it was extremely my shit&#x201D;. The little synth horns and flutes on this thing are so good. Love how many moments just don&#x2019;t have drums? The Taste or Waste crew heard Stardew Valley in &#x201C;thank you for recording&#x201D; but I hear, like&#x2026; Microsoft Encarta? Computer programmers who are obsessed with Kraftwerk? It&#x2019;s icy and weird but kinda boppy, it&#x2019;s got features by bladee and underscores, it&#x2019;s hitting all the right notes for me. I&#x2019;m not quite convinced it&#x2019;s all-timer album material but I am definitely going to enjoy it right now
