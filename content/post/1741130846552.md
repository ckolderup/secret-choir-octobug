Last year&#x27;s album _It&#x27;s Sorted_ felt kind of like they had polished the whole Cheekface bit to a perfect point so it&#x27;s not surprising that this one would be a ~transitional record~; it sounds like the members of the band have been through a lot in the last year (relatable!) and this album is being kind of press junketed as the result of that but I&#x27;m not sure that really pays off. I think it&#x27;s cool that they collaborated with McKinley Dixon for &#x22;Military Gum&#x22; but I&#x27;m not sure the result is as good as a Cheekface track or a McKinley Dixon track. &#x22;Growth Sux&#x22; has a funny and possibly insightful point but to me it feels like they barely scratched the surface and I find it hard to say where their commonly-employed satirical voice ends on the topic, which sort of defeats the point of their whole schtick.

I do think there&#x27;s something cool that&#x27;s happening with Cheekface&#x27;s particular blend of music and writing and comedy and politics and I want to see it continue and get better and smarter. There are individual moments on here that are catchy enough that I&#x27;m sure they will pop into my head unbidden for years to come (&#x22;Wind is Gone&#x22;&#x27;s refrain of &#x22;Dial 999-9999&#x22; has been on loop, maddeningly, for the past 48 hours), but... I dunno. I&#x27;m not seeing the depth that I know they are capable of.
