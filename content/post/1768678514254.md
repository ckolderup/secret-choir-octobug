Some people are probably familiar with the Special Herbs instrumentals, which MF Doom released under the &#x22;Metal Fingers&#x22; alias and represent beats he made for both his own albums as well as ones he contributed to artists like MC Paul Barman, but what I think some people might not know is that the &#x22;Box Set&#x22; release, because it was made in the pre-streaming era, has significantly shorter versions of each track than the individual (well, technically two at at time) &#x22;Volume&#x22; releases. If you really want to luxuriate in these beats, skip the &#x22;Box Set&#x22; and check out the split releases!
