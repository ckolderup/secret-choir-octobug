Cliffdiver&#x27;s second full-length album really delivered for me. It&#x27;s not surprising in hindsight that their debut album [Exercise Your Demons](https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/album/exercise-your-demons) wouldn&#x27;t live up to the high expectations set by their 2020 song [Gas City](https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/track/gas-city); it&#x27;s by all means a good album but for me it lacked the sort of top-tier memorability that I&#x27;m looking for when listening to this sort of on-the-nose pop-punk &#x22;DIY&#x22; music. Birdwatching, as a counterpoint, sold me from the very start with opener &#x22;thirty, flirty, and thriving!!!&#x22; Co-lead vocalists Joey Duffy and Briana Wright are both extremely charming, the band&#x27;s work continues to be my favorite use of the saxophone in recent memory, the whole album kinda breezes by and dares you to go back to the start and listen all over again like many of my favorite albums this year, and I would like one hundred more years of Cliffdiver songs to put me in a good mood and make me feel thirty years old again.
