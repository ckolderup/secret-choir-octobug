I felt ready to put this on just about any time-- as a plane was landing, when I couldn't sleep, when I had a quiet afternoon sitting around peacefully with my parents in my new living room, when I was walking around a new part of San Francisco I had never been in before (near the Moscone Center? lol), just any time really. I guess that makes it the next in a series:</p>\n<p>2024 - this one<br>\n2023 - overmono - good lies<br>\n2022 - sadurn - radiator<br>\n2021 - ross from friends - tread<br>\n2020 - cartalk - pass like pollen<br>\n2019 - glass beach - the first glass beach album</p>\n"

I do feel like this is a return to <em>Modern Vampires</em> success but also I feel a little bit guilty about feeling that way because of the <em>signifiers</em></p>\n"

Listen to this album if you're a little goblin in the forest in an RPG Maker game</p>\n"
