It's unfortunately brief, weighing in at just 19 minutes across 7 tracks, but I had it in the rotation pretty regularly in 2024. The lofi music videos put out over the course of the year match the vibe pretty well. More of this please!</p>\n"

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://durante.bandcamp.com/album/enter\">https://durante.bandcamp.com/album/enter</a></p>\n<p>the \"You Could Make a Case For\" series is for albums that did not spring to mind for me immediately, but when reviewing the stuff I did actually listen to this year, I noticed them as things that I definitely did find myself pressing play on during the course of the year.</p>\n<p>I first learned about Durante via the 2019 Fabric DJ mix by electronic artist Bonobo, an album I listened to constantly both by myself and when putting on music for other people. His track \"Maia\" swoops in beautifully and while he didn't have many tracks released at that point, I was excited eventually to discover his 2021 song \"Thread Tension\", a driving, hypnotic track. There were some releases here and there but it was this year's <em>Enter</em> and the accompanying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWdIkR-6Vio\">February</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh246_Mgk7o\">May</a> DJ mixes that I could tell there was something special he was doing, creating a sound I'm really glad to have had available to me this year.</p>\n"

I felt ready to put this on just about any time-- as a plane was landing, when I couldn't sleep, when I had a quiet afternoon sitting around peacefully with my parents in my new living room, when I was walking around a new part of San Francisco I had never been in before (near the Moscone Center? lol), just any time really. I guess that makes it the next in a series:</p>\n<p>2024 - this one<br>\n2023 - overmono - good lies<br>\n2022 - sadurn - radiator<br>\n2021 - ross from friends - tread<br>\n2020 - cartalk - pass like pollen<br>\n2019 - glass beach - the first glass beach album</p>\n"
