			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/album/birdwatching\">https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/album/birdwatching</a></p>\n<p>Cliffdiver's second full-length album really delivered for me. It's not surprising in hindsight that their debut album <a href=\"https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/album/exercise-your-demons\">Exercise Your Demons</a> wouldn't live up to the high expectations set by their 2020 song <a href=\"https://cliffdiverok.bandcamp.com/track/gas-city\">Gas City</a>; it's by all means a good album but for me it lacked the sort of top-tier memorability that I'm looking for when listening to this sort of on-the-nose pop-punk \"DIY\" music. Birdwatching, as a counterpoint, sold me from the very start with opener \"thirty, flirty, and thriving!!!\" Co-lead vocalists Joey Duffy and Briana Wright are both extremely charming, the band's work continues to be my favorite use of the saxophone in recent memory, the whole album kinda breezes by and dares you to go back to the start and listen all over again like many of my favorite albums this year, and I would like one hundred more years of Cliffdiver songs to put me in a good mood and make me feel thirty years old again.</p>\n"

It's unfortunately brief, weighing in at just 19 minutes across 7 tracks, but I had it in the rotation pretty regularly in 2024. The lofi music videos put out over the course of the year match the vibe pretty well. More of this please!</p>\n"

			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://durante.bandcamp.com/album/enter\">https://durante.bandcamp.com/album/enter</a></p>\n<p>the \"You Could Make a Case For\" series is for albums that did not spring to mind for me immediately, but when reviewing the stuff I did actually listen to this year, I noticed them as things that I definitely did find myself pressing play on during the course of the year.</p>\n<p>I first learned about Durante via the 2019 Fabric DJ mix by electronic artist Bonobo, an album I listened to constantly both by myself and when putting on music for other people. His track \"Maia\" swoops in beautifully and while he didn't have many tracks released at that point, I was excited eventually to discover his 2021 song \"Thread Tension\", a driving, hypnotic track. There were some releases here and there but it was this year's <em>Enter</em> and the accompanying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWdIkR-6Vio\">February</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vh246_Mgk7o\">May</a> DJ mixes that I could tell there was something special he was doing, creating a sound I'm really glad to have had available to me this year.</p>\n"

I felt ready to put this on just about any time-- as a plane was landing, when I couldn't sleep, when I had a quiet afternoon sitting around peacefully with my parents in my new living room, when I was walking around a new part of San Francisco I had never been in before (near the Moscone Center? lol), just any time really. I guess that makes it the next in a series:</p>\n<p>2024 - this one<br>\n2023 - overmono - good lies<br>\n2022 - sadurn - radiator<br>\n2021 - ross from friends - tread<br>\n2020 - cartalk - pass like pollen<br>\n2019 - glass beach - the first glass beach album</p>\n"
